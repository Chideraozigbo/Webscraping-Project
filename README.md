# Web Scraping Project: 100 Most Highly-Ranked Films

## Overview

This data engineering project involves web scraping to gather information about the 100 most highly-ranked films listed on the [EverybodyWiki](https://web.archive.org/web/20230902185655/https://en.everybodywiki.com/100_Most_Highly-Ranked_Films) website. The primary goal is to provide a curated dataset for data scientists and analysts to perform further exploration and analysis.

## Project Highlights

- **Web Scraping Technique:** Utilizing Python and the BeautifulSoup library, the web scraping script navigates through the website's HTML structure to extract film details such as title, film, and average_rank.

- **Data Engineering Process:** The Jupyter Notebook **Web_Scraping.ipynb** documents the data engineering process, including web scraping, data cleaning, and structuring the dataset for downstream analysis.

- **CSV Data for Exploration:** The final dataset is stored in **The_100_most_highly_ranked_films.csv**, offering a structured and accessible format for data scientists and analysts to dive into the cinematic insights.

## Purpose

This project is tailored to support data professionals in:

- Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the top 100 highly-ranked films.
- Extracting valuable insights for film industry trends.
- Creating visualizations and reports for stakeholders based on the curated dataset.

## Notes

- **Ethical Web Scraping:** Always adhere to ethical web scraping practices and respect the terms of service of the website.

- **Educational Use:** This project is designed for educational purposes and professional exploration of data engineering skills in the context of web scraping.
